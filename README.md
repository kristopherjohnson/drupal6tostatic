This is a set of scripts I wrote to migrate my blog from Drupal 6 to a static site generator.

For more details, see <http://undefinedvalue.com/rebuilding-my-blog-again.html>

Scripts:

- dumpdb.sh: Exports data from Drupal 6 blog database
- dbconvert.py: Generates static-site-generator pages from the database data
